## 📝Documentation
I present to you my password creation script in python. It allows you to generate a random password with the duration you want.

### Feature 💻
---
_You can :_
- Choose the length
- Add capital letters
- Add lowercase
- Add numbers
- Add special characters

```
For example, you can make a password with only special characters.
```

Moreover, once the password is generated, it will automatically copy it to the clipboard and save it to `key/key_generate.pub`
You can view the file at any time.
```
⚠️ If you run the program a second time, the old code will be overwritten! Don't forget to save it 😉
```
This file contains the source code with project dependencies. There is also a bat file `generate_key.bat`
